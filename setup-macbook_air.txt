Overview
========

This guide covers installation of Debian 8.1 on a 2011 Macbook Air, without
setting up a dual boot OS X - GNU/Linux system. I don't guarantee that
everything here will work perfectly on other Macbook Air models. However, I
suspect that most of this should work for other Macbooks as well.

This guide is up to date as of August 2015, using Debian 8.1.

Installation
============

The Macbook Air doesn't play well with most bootable flash drives (absent
installing a custom bootloader with OS X still on the computer, such as rEFIT),
so it's much easier to install from a CD/DVD. For the Macbok Air, you'll have
to use an external CD/DVD drive. To force the Macbook to boot from the CD/DVD
drive, hold "C" during the boot sequence.

The hardware is well-supported out of the box, with the exception of the
wireless card (which requires non-free firmware that isn't included with Debian
images). The easiest solution to this is to have a separate USB stick available
with the appropriate wireless card firmware package to be used during
installation.  The specific package you'll need is the `firmware-brcm80211`
package, which can be found at:

  https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=firmware-brcm80211

At least for me, I needed to have an internet connection for GRUB installation,
otherwise you'll get a grub-pc install error, and the system won't be
bootable. You can either use the USB stick with the wireless firmware method
discussed above, or use a USB-ethernet adapter.

Also, I had much better luck with the command-line based install than the live
CD install. Not sure why.

Dual booting Debian with OS X is a much messier situation than single booting
Debian alone. Setting up a dual boot system is outside of the scope of this
guide.

Other notes
===========
I haven't tried connecting the Macbook Air to an external display.

Keyboard configuration
======================

The default Macbook keyboard is not particularly suitable for development,
etc. on Debian. This is the custom keyboard configuration I use, using
setxkbmap:

Caps Lock -> Escape, Swap alt (option) and super (command) keys:

  setxkbmap -rules "evdev" -layout "us" -option "caps:escape" -option
  "altwin:swap_alt_win"

To swap the function lock for the Fn keys, use:

  sudo bash -c "echo 2 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode"

Note: You have to include `bash -C` because the output redirection ">" is done
by the shell, not by ``echo``. You have to login as root (or run a bash string)
with sudo in order to get the pipe to work correctly, otherwise you get a
permissions error.

General notes on using setxkbmap:

* To reset the key settings, run:

  setxkbmap -layout "us"

* To look at all the options for setxkbmap, see (or grep) the file:

  /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst
